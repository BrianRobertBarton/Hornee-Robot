 by Brian Robert Barton KC2FQN

 This Program Plays 5 Horns In A Random Pattern.

 Simply connect 5 5v Power Relays to the five outputs labled below
 and circuit board gnd. Then add 5 Junyard Horns, one to each of
 the Power Relays switched output and all five to chassis ground.
 Using fused 12v from car battery, daisey chain one side of each
 the Power Relays switched output. A Push Button activates the
 program by going from +5v from the board to a digital input labled
 below and operates as a typical Horn Button would on a car
